      ## Case Study: Fizz buzz

      > Given a number either output
      > * "Fizz", if its divisable by three
      > * "buzz", if its divisable by five
      > * otherwise the number itself

      # Poker Hands

      Your job is to compare several pairs of poker hands and to indicate
      which, if either, has a higher rank.

      # Poker Rules

      ---

      A poker deck contains 52 cards - each card has a suit which is one of
      clubs, diamonds, hearts, or spades (denoted C, D, H, and S in the input
      data). Each card also has a value which is one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
      9, 10, jack, queen, king, ace (denoted 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q,
      K, A). For scoring purposes, the suits are unordered while the values
      are ordered as given above, with 2 being the lowest and ace the highest
      value.

      ---

      A poker hand consists of 5 cards dealt from the deck. Poker hands are
      ranked by the following partial order from lowest to highest.

      * High Card: Hands which do not fit any higher category are ranked by
      the value of their highest card. If the highest cards have the same
      value, the hands are ranked by the next highest, and so on.

      * Pair: 2 of the 5 cards in the hand have the same value. Hands which
      both contain a pair are ranked by the value of the cards forming the
      pair. If these values are the same, the hands are ranked by the values
      of the cards not forming the pair, in decreasing order.

      * Two Pairs: The hand contains 2 different pairs. Hands which both
      contain 2 pairs are ranked by the value of their highest pair. Hands
      with the same highest pair are ranked by the value of their other
      pair. If these values are the same the hands are ranked by the value of
      the remaining card.

      ---

      * Three of a Kind: Three of the cards in the hand have the same
      value. Hands which both contain three of a kind are ranked by the value
      of the 3 cards.

      * Straight: Hand contains 5 cards with consecutive values. Hands which
      both contain a straight are ranked by their highest card.

      * Flush: Hand contains 5 cards of the same suit. Hands which are both
      flushes are ranked using the rules for High Card.

      * Full House: 3 cards of the same value, with the remaining 2 cards
      forming a pair. Ranked by the value of the 3 cards.

      * Four of a kind: 4 cards with the same value. Ranked by the value of
      the 4 cards.

      * Straight flush: 5 cards of the same suit with consecutive
      values. Ranked by the highest card in the hand.
